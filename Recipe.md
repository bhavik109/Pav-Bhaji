Step 1
Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Add onion and 1/4 teaspoon salt; fry until browned, 5 to 8 minutes. Add garlic; cook and stir for 4 minutes. Pour in 1 cup water. Add 1 teaspoon pav bhaji masala and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until flavors combine, about 10 minutes.

Step 2
Add tomatoes, potatoes, and corn to the saucepan. Season with chile powder, coriander, and ginger. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 15 minutes. Mash curry gently with the back of a wooden spoon or spatula. Simmer for 10 minutes more. Taste and adjust salt. Add 1/2 teaspoon pav bhaji masala and lemon juice. Mash slightly again.

Step 3
Add 1/4 to 1/2 cup water to give curry a runny consistency. Add remaining 1 tablespoon oil and butter; stir until butter is melted. Divide into serving bowls and sprinkle remaining pav bhaji masala on top.
